# Test Example 1:

x = 2*3 > 6
print("The value of x is:")
print(x)

print("")  # Prints a blank line

print("The inverse value of x is:")
print(not x)

# What happens when you negate a False statement?


today = "Monday"
print(not today == "Tuesday")


# The "today" variable states today is Monday. This makes the comparison
# "today == Tuesday" False. The logical operator "not" inverts the False
# result to become True. In other words, this expression asks if it is
# false that today is not Tuesday. More succinctly, "not False" means
# True."
